            <h4>Disc Test:</h4>
            <p>The DISC test result put me in category
                <b>S: the steady person</b>. If I'm going to be honest, I find such tests
                utterly ridiculous and don't agree with
                them what so ever. You're trying to divide humans into groups that don't match? Sure, I have some
                trademarks of the
                steady person, but I also have trademarks of the other types and most of all, I can find myself in all
                types and
                also in none. And that goes for almost all of us. But hey, you know, maybe I'm wrong? Let's just see
                what the future
                brings right ;)</p>

            <h4>The movie: Patser</h4>
            <p>So, we went to see the movie 'Patser' by
                <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adil_El_Arbi" target="blank">Adil El
                    Arbi
                </a>
                (couldn't find an English link, sorry!) in the Kinepolis of Ghent. I normally don't expect much from
                the Dutch movie industry
                and with that thought in mind, I went to watch the movie with 0 expectations. I've got to say, I was
                surprised in
                a good way! I really did not expect it to be this 'good'. Okay, sure, there were some scenes where he
                over did it
                in my opinion and as he had warned us that for many of the cast, it was their first acting performance
                ever and so,
                the acting wasn't always that great but overall, I would give it a solid 7/10. I've seen better movies
                but also a
                lot worse!
                <br />You can find the trailer right here:

            <h4>Power Distance</h4>
            <p>As we were told, I made my task about the power distance in both Russia and Sweden. I made a statement
                that in countries
                with more power distance, you would earn more as a boss than as a normal employee. I did my research
                and found out
                that in Russia, a CEO earns about 2 340 244 &#8381; as an average salary. In Sweden, a CEO earans about
                1 275 227
                &#x6b;&#x72;. If we convert both currencies to the euro, we get in Russia an average of 33 059.16
                &euro; and in Sweden
                an average of 126 720.22 &euro;. You can clearly see that my statement was wrong.

            <h4>Week 1: The Start-up</h4>
            <p>12/3/2018 &ndash; 18/3/2018</p>
            <p>So, we decided to do a crowd-sourced battery charging app/service called
                <b>PowerUp&trade;</b>. The idea is to create a community where nobody has to run out of battery ever
                again. We plan
                to make charging up your electronics a piece of cake with charge points everywhere, a map to indicate
                the nearest
                charging point and so much more! The crowd-sourced charging would be based upon people who can install
                a "plug" somewhere
                on the outside of their house. If they were to supply electricity to the people, they would get
                rewarded for it that
                it wouldn't be a 0-operation for them.
                <br /> At this point, I can't share much about our project seeing how everything is being worked out
                and we're only in
                the development stage. I'll keep giving updates on how our project progresses. For now, I can give you
                at least a
                sneak peak of how our current (and certainly not finished) app logo looks like:
                <img src="../IMAGES/Crowd charged logo.png" alt="first app logo" class="responsive-img"> </p>
            <br />

            <h4>Week 2 &amp; 3: Our value for society</h4>
            <p>19/3/2018 &ndash; 1/4/2018</p>
            <p>We've been working hard on our project these last two weeks and we've made some pretty big changes. The
                first change
                I want to talk about is the fact that we had a name change. I didn't like PowerUp and so I started a
                poll with a
                few other names and it seems like I'm not the only one who wanted another name. Eventually we came to
                an agreement
                and we changed our name to
                <b>ChargeBy&trade;</b>. With a new name also came a new logo. I laid the foundations for it by
                sketching something and
                the group seemed to like it, so we worked it out further. I'm very happy with how it turned out. Here's
                a preview:

                <br />
                <br />
                <h5>Company name:</h5>
                <br />
                <img src="../IMAGES/Company-Logo.png" alt="The company Name" class="responsive-img">
                <br />
                <br />
                <h5>Slogan:</h5>
                <br />
                <img src="../IMAGES/Company-Slogan.png" alt="The company Slogan" class="responsive-img">
                <br />
                <br />
                <h5>Company logo:</h5>
                <br />
                <img src="../IMAGES/App-Logo.png" alt="The Company Logo" class="responsive-img center-align bs">
                <br />
                <br /> Now for our value to society: I think we all know how annoying it can get when your phone or
                your electric skateboard
                or ... has run out of battery. They always do at the exact wrong moments. Now, you don't ever have to
                worry about
                that any longer. We think we can add a lot of value to society just by making sure their batteries stay
                topped off!
            </p>

            <h4>The commercial</h4>
            <p>2/4/2018 &ndash; 2/5/2018</p>
            <p>We really had a blast shooting our commercial and editing it all. I think it turned out ok for
                non-professional editors
                and camera crew. We tried to speak to the average person with an electronic device and I think we
                reached them!
                <br />If you want to watch our commercial, you can find a link right here:

                </a>
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>My value to the team</h4>
            <p>As you all know by now and as de disc test has pointed out, I'm the reliable kind of guy in the team. I
                make sure we
                do our tasks and we finish them. As such, I performed my part and made sure we all did what we had to
                do. Sometimes
                I had to motivate them a bit harder than other times, but I guess that's my task. I also got to do the
                tasks which
                I liked the most so I ain't complaining!</p>

            <h4>Object Oriented Programming</h4>
            <p>Our big project for the second half of semester 2, year 1 is making the well-known game:
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)" target="blank">Mastermind</a>.
                It's a very fun project with very good friends and it is going very well! We're right on schedule
                and we've already learned a lot! Once we're finished, I'll upload a link to the GitHub repository.
                <br />
                <br /> It's time to give you guys and girls an update: we're coming close to the end of our semester
                and out project is
                nearing the end as well. We've come a long way and I couldn't be more proud and happy with that we've
                accomplished.
                Our GUI looks and feels smooth, our business logic is in place, last bugs are being worked out and
                overall, we've
                made something that truly works great!

                and I found an article that was almost the movie itself. The similarities between the two were insane.
                Some examples:
                <ul>
                    <li>- both spoke of the third world war in Belgium and Netherlands</li>
                    <li>- the whole scene where the girl was hanging above a machine</li>
                    <li>- two others got words burnt into their faces and chests</li>
                    <li>- ...</li>
