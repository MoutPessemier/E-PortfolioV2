# E-portfolio-V2

In my first year as a CS student, I got the task to create an e-portfolio. Most of my fellow students just took a template but I wanted to make it myself to show off my development throughout the years and so I did. This is the second version of my portfolio with some JavaScript sprinkled in there. During my 3 years, I've been steadily updating the layout, the files and the content of my portfolio.
